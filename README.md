## Market research on products I will sell through Etsy

I'm interested in learning how to price and market my products by analyzing current prices for similar types of art pieces. I am also using this process to develop my coding and data analysis skills. 

### Directory Structure

This repo features subfolders for the different types of products I will be selling on Etsy. These subfolders contain files on product research.

| Folder | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `DigitalPrints`  | prints made through digital art applications |
| `TradPrints`  | prints of artwork made with traditional art media |
| `Stickers`  | sticker versions of the digital/trad(itional) art prints |
| `Clothing`  | shirts and socks featuring original art |
| `Accessories`  | pins, tote bags and pocket mirrors featuring original art |

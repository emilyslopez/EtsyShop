    "# Market Research for Custom Digital Prints on Etsy\n",
    "### Looking into current market for custom digital art that features minimalist drawings of customer photos\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of customer photos used in this work include couple photos for anniversaries and friend group photos/sibling photos for birthdays. Although this research is not extensive, I can still get a glimpse of the current market for this product. To conduct this work, I refrenced advice given by content creator Creative Hive in her video, [How to Price Art Prints](https://youtu.be/d0KJnkw9U2E). Specific notes followed are listed at the end of this notebook.\n",

    "**Notes on descriptions:** \n",
    "* My opinion on product quality (consider colors, details/texture vs price): wow!!, wow!, wow, meh\n",
    "* Bestseller: Item has had a high sales volume over the past 6 months\n",

    "* Descriptions say \"one person\", \"two people\", \"more than two\", etc. to refer to the amount of people featured in the drawings. Descriptions with \"with eyes/eyes\" and \"background\" mean the artist offers drawings that feature the eyes or background in the customer's photo.\n",
